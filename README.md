# Fong_ENV872_FinalProject
ENV872 Final Project for Vicky Fong (Fall 2024)

## Summary
Project Title: Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Cownose Rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) in North Carolina

Why: Cownose rays are classified as a "Vulnerable" species on the IUCN Red List. Local populations in North Carolina have declined due to negative interactions with commericial shellfish fisheries. Minimal research has been conducted to investigate recent distributions of cownose rays in North Carolina.

Project Goals: This project aims to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of cownose rays in North Carolina using open-source data.
