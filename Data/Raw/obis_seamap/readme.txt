You've downloaded data from OBIS-SEAMAP.

Please observe the Terms of Use, which is included in the zipped file, 
for your use of the data. Most important is that you are required to
give proper attribution (citation) to the dataset(s) / data provider(s) 
for the use of the data in any publication or product.

Please also go through the metadata to ensure the proper use of the data. 
The metadata is written in compliance with the FGDC metadata standards 
and ready to be used in ESRI ArcCatalog. You can also view it online.

The citations and links to the online FGDB metadata are included in 
the datasets_and_citations.csv file and zipped together.

Also, all the metadata files are placed under fgdc_metadata folder. 
This sub folder usually contains only one metadata file for a dataset download.
It may contain a number of metadata files for a download of the species data or
a custom-built map on the Advanced Search.

If you have questions regarding your download, please contact us at seamap-contact@duke.edu.
For the download with "On map" mode, please make the Request ID handy
